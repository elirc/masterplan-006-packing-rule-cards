# Rebuild Packing Rule Cards through small verified slices

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

This is a hypothetical reconstruction exercise using the existing reference as a comparison point. Work on a practice branch or a separate scratch copy. Do not erase the working reference. Your goal is to recover the important decisions from requirements, not reproduce every character or configuration file from memory.

## Session zero: write a contract you can challenge

Temperature is a finite number. Weather is dry, rain or wind. Below 10 is cold; 10 through values below 25 is mild; 25 and above is warm. Every result owns a fresh items array.

Your target skill is variables, booleans and branches. Write three examples before implementation: one ordinary success, one boundary distinction and one recovery or repeat sequence. Reuse the fixed reference fixtures only after making a prediction. If your new example is outside the documented scope, decide whether to reject it or explicitly expand the contract; do not let an incidental implementation choice decide silently.

Write a short non-goal list tied to this exercise. Non-goals keep an assistant from adding a database, a UI framework or a broad refactor before you understand the central rule. For static layout work, a meaningful non-goal may be scripting interactions that native HTML already handles. For stateful work, it may be remote persistence or a global state container.

## Slice 1: Write the threshold table

**Reference context:** Start with 9.99, 10, 24.99 and 25. Those four values force you to decide equality at both thresholds. Add a weather column and compute the expected item list by hand. Ordinary values such as 15 are useful, but they cannot expose an incorrect < versus <= operator at the boundary.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **9.99, dry → cold; water bottle and warm layer**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.
3. Build the smallest version that can express the example. Start with explicit data and direct control flow. Introduce a helper only when you can name its input, output and reason to change.
4. Observe the result through the real boundary: a command, a browser control, or a layout condition. A function returning the right value does not prove a button passes it the right input.
5. Add a neighboring example that would fail if you special-cased the first one. Review your diff before comparing with the reference.

### Pause at the first uncertainty

Write the smallest question you cannot answer. It might concern ownership, a comparison operator, the effect of deleting a property, or when a callback actually runs. Include the exact expression and an example. Ask a mentor for one clue, then return to the source; avoid requesting a complete replacement implementation.

### Inspect an alternative

Choose one plausible different design for this slice. Describe the extra state, dependency or maintenance rule it introduces. If it satisfies the same contract, it is not automatically wrong. Compare the cost of making the next small change. If it violates the contract, provide the smallest concrete example that demonstrates that violation.

### Capture a reviewable stopping point

Record your actual check: npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. State what it established and what remains untested. Use a commit message about the resulting behavior rather than a list of file names. If the slice does not work yet, keep the uncertainty visible in the journal instead of writing a success narrative.

**Left for you:** the code, fixture values beyond the supplied example, exact naming and the acceptance evidence. The reference is available for comparison after an attempt; it is not evidence that your branch has passed.

## Slice 2: Keep parsing out of the domain rule

**Reference context:** Open app.js to see that form values arrive as text. Blank input is rejected before Number is called. Then open core.js: it still rejects strings, NaN and Infinity because another caller might bypass the form. The core has one clear contract rather than guessing what arbitrary input should mean.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **10, rain → mild; water bottle, light layer, raincoat**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.
3. Build the smallest version that can express the example. Start with explicit data and direct control flow. Introduce a helper only when you can name its input, output and reason to change.

## Slice 3: Return an explanation-shaped result

**Reference context:** The function returns band, weather and items. This structure is sufficient for the UI to display a card and for tests to inspect the actual decision. Do not return a preformatted HTML string from the calculation. The new array is constructed inside each call, so changes to one result do not become hidden global state.

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.

## Slice 4: Show failures without losing inputs

**Reference context:** The form prevents its default navigation and catches the core’s errors. It writes a visible error message but leaves the input controls intact. A later successful submission removes the error class. Verify the sequence invalid → corrected, because a page can show the correct result while accidentally keeping error styling from the prior attempt.

## Reconstruct the whole path without the guide

The form reads a string → numberFromInput rejects blank and converts a finite number → recommendPacking validates its own contract → the temperature branch chooses a band → the weather branch adds an item → app.js renders the returned data.

Close this page and redraw that route from memory using your own labels. Open the code only to resolve a specific uncertainty. Then trace a different valid input and one boundary. If your picture requires a hidden value that you cannot locate in the source, investigate it; diagrams can invent state just as easily as prose can.

## Compare your implementation fairly

First compare behavior and evidence. Only then compare style and abstractions. A shorter implementation may be harder for you to explain; a longer implementation may duplicate a rule that later drifts. State the concrete tradeoff. Do not treat matching the reference line for line as the only successful outcome.

## Finish with a teach-back

Explain why `recommendPacking` is enough for its present responsibility, which work remains in `public/app.js`, and which future requirement would justify changing that boundary. Answer the original transfer question: Which input makes two apparently equivalent conditions behave differently? Keep the answer short enough that another junior can challenge it with an example.
