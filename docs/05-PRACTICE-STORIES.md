# Six junior practice stories

[Debugging lab](04-DEBUGGING-LAB.md) · [Hints — use after an attempt](06-HINTS-AND-ANSWERS.md)

These are new exercises beyond the finished reference. No story is marked complete for you. Start a branch such as practice/story-01 and write acceptance examples before editing. Each plan leaves the actual code, wording and one design choice to you.

## Story 01: Explain the chosen band

**Feature boundary:** Add a reason string derived from the branch that selected the band.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `recommendPacking` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Boundary examples and displayed explanations agree.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Acceptance evidence:** Boundary examples and displayed explanations agree.

**Left for you:** exact fixture values, names, wording, the implementation and the tradeoff decision. Do not open the hints until you have an example and a first attempt.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 02: Add a reset action

**Feature boundary:** Add a button that restores the example inputs and clears previous output.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `recommendPacking` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Reset does not submit the form or call the core unexpectedly.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Acceptance evidence:** Reset does not submit the form or call the core unexpectedly.

**Left for you:** exact fixture values, names, wording, the implementation and the tradeoff decision. Do not open the hints until you have an example and a first attempt.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 03: Support one new weather value

**Feature boundary:** Choose a fourth fictional condition and extend validation, rule and UI together.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `recommendPacking` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Unknown values still fail; the new value adds only its documented item.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.

## Story 04: Show the input in the result

**Feature boundary:** Include the temperature used in the displayed card without changing core input types.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `recommendPacking` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The displayed input matches the submitted value, including zero.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

## Story 05: Strengthen one boundary test

**Feature boundary:** Write a new test that would fail for a plausible incorrect comparison.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `recommendPacking` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Demonstrate the failure against the wrong comparison before restoring the correct code.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.

## Story 06: Add a pure explanation formatter

**Feature boundary:** Extract result-to-text formatting from the event handler into a small function.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `recommendPacking` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Formatting can be tested without a DOM and does not alter the items array.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Additional planning checkpoints for stories 01–06

[Nine more stories, 07–15](11-NINE-MORE-STORIES.md) · [Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md)

Keep the original plans above. The following checkpoints add implementation and review depth without completing the exercise for you.

### Story 01 planning clinic: Explain the chosen band

**Before editing:** restate the boundary in your own words: Add a reason string derived from the branch that selected the band. Identify the part of `public/core.js` or `public/app.js` that owns it. If your proposed design changes another owner, explain the dependency instead of opening every file for a broad rewrite.

**Acceptance matrix:** write ordinary, boundary and repeat/recovery rows that establish “Boundary examples and displayed explanations agree.” Include exact starting data or content and the expected retained information. Calculate expected values or inspect meaningful source order independently of the proposed implementation.

**First implementation slice:** make only enough of the change to demonstrate one acceptance row. Inspect the diff and predict the next row before running it. If your first slice is mostly setup or abstraction with no observable result, consider a smaller direct route.

**Review challenge:** sketch a plausible wrong solution that would pass a casual demonstration. Choose a counterexample that exposes its specific weakness. Ask an assistant to critique that example rather than immediately asking it to finish the entire feature.

**Evidence and explanation:** use npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. Record the actual observation and the limit of the check. Finish by naming a design decision you made yourself and explaining why the neighboring original behavior still holds.

### Story 02 planning clinic: Add a reset action

**Before editing:** restate the boundary in your own words: Add a button that restores the example inputs and clears previous output.
